            Our system maps ambulance routes by using Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest paths, and the A* algorithm with heuristics to calculate obstacle-free, efficient routes. Supported by a robust database of road networks and real-time traffic data, it ensures fast and reliable emergency response.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            Emergency medical services often face delays due to inefficient routing, traffic congestion, and unpredictable obstacles on the road. These delays can significantly impact patient outcomes, as every second counts during critical emergencies. Existing systems lack real-time adaptive routing that can navigate obstacles and traffic dynamically to ensure the fastest and safest ambulance arrival.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            Our project harnesses powerful pathfinding algorithms—using Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest routes and the A* algorithm with heuristics to efficiently navigate around obstacles. User-friendly interactive map,to ensure ambulances reach their destinations quickly and safely.
